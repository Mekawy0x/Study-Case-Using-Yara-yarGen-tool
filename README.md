# Study-Case-Using-Yara-yarGen-tool
# Introduction

This project demonstrates how to utilize YARA and Yargen tools for malware detection through a case study. YARA is a tool designed to help researchers identify and classify malware, while Yargen is a tool that automatically generates YARA rules based on given binary samples or strings. The study case involves analyzing a set of malicious binaries, generating YARA rules, and using those rules to detect similar threats.

# Tools

	•	YARA: A tool used to create descriptions of malware families (YARA rules) based on textual or binary patterns found in malicious files.
	•	Yargen: A YARA rule generator that takes samples of malware and creates YARA signatures based on those samples.

# Prerequisites

Before running this study case, ensure that the following are installed:

	•	YARA: [YARA GitHub Repository](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara)
	•	Yargen: [Yargen GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Neo23x0/yarGen)

# Install the necessary dependencies by following the installation guides in the respective repositories.

# Study Case Overview
We have a malicious file (steam_api.dll), by using Yara and yarGen tool to detect pattern of it.
